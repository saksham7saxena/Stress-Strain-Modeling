# Stress-Strain-Modeling

This Python script models the stress-strain behavior of a composite material by simulating its response under different strain values. It calculates the modulus of elasticity based on fiber orientation angles (beta), volume fraction (vf), and weighting factors (phi). The script uses cosine squared functions to model directional stiffness contributions and applies a weighted sum approach to estimate the overall stress. The results are plotted as stress-strain curves, providing insights into the composite's mechanical properties under different conditions.
